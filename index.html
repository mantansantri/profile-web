            <p class="p-about">
              My name is Haikal Ammar Waluya, I was born in Surabaya, but now I live in Tangerang because of family matters. I am the first child of four siblings. I lived in Surabaya for only two years, then I moved to Tangerang and lived there. I started school in Tangerang when I was in the third grade of elementary school. The name of the SD is Pondok Ranji 03 SDN which is located in an area called Pertamina. After 4 years I went to school in Tangerang, I went back to school at an Islamic boarding school in Pandeglang called Riyadhussholihiin. After one year of studying there, I entered a department called Daar Asy-Syari'ah. There I fully studied religion and Arabic, not studying general subjects at all, unlike when I was in seventh grade, who also studied general subjects. So from that I became a person who is used to speaking Arabic. In fact, when I was there I used to speak Arabic and only sometimes I used Indonesian. Usually I speak Indonesian when I chat with my friends, the rest I use Arabic. But somehow my grades in Arabic are always bad. After I studied for 2 years at Daar Asy-Syari'ah, I decided to move to another school, because I wanted to find a new atmosphere. At first I wanted to go to Al-Furqon, Gresik. but because I heard from my cousin that it was uncomfortable there, I switched to IDN Jonggol. When I searched for IDN, I found that there is an IDN that is not as arid as in Jonggol. I finally decided to register at IDN solo and Alhamdulillah, I was accepted there.
